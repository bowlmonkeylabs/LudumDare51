  Subject: ONIONS PLEASE READ!!!
  Body: 'People are always worried about mayonnaise will spoil, but when food poisoning
    is reported, the first thing officials look for is when the ''victim'' last ate
    ONIONS and where those onions came from. Onions are a huge magnet for bacteria,
    especially uncooked onions.

    Please pass this on to all you love and care
    about.'
